          <h4>Design</h4>
          I learned alot during working on this project and the first key
          learning was the importance of a robust design architecture for the
          project.I tried to adopt Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles :
          <Image src="/assets/clean_architecture.jpg" />
          <br />
          Following the diagram the design pattern I followed for this project
          is the Command Query Request Segregation (CQRS) Pattern(Single DB).
          Using MediatR to make use of Command/Query Handler Logic and have
          setup my projects as follows:
