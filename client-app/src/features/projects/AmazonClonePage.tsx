        Like the name suggests this is a simple clone of Amazon. I took up this
        project as a means of learning and practicing front-end development with
        React 🐱‍👓

      <Para>
        Starting out with learning React, this little project was able to cover
        a lot of important bases for me like: React Hooks, React Functional
        Components, routing with React Router DOM and how to use React Context
        API for state management(still learning more about this 😋). I also
        realised the tremendous amount of effort and consideration that goes
        into creating a rich user experience even a simple change of a css
        property like a margin on a button can change the look and feel of the
        experience 🤩.
