          Like the name suggests this is a simple clone of Amazon. I took up
          this project as a means of learning and practicing front-end
          development with React üê±‚Äçüëì

          Starting out with learning React, this little project was able to
          cover a lot of important bases for me like: React Hooks, React
          Functional Components, routing with React Router DOM and how to use
          React Context API for state management(still learning more about this
          üòã). I also realised the tremendous amount of effort and consideration
          that goes into creating a rich user experience even a simple change of
          a css property like a margin on a button can change the look and feel
          of the experience ü§©.
