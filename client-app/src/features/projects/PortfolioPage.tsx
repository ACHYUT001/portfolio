        but overtime I though it'd be best to evolve this into a website where I
        can show off my projects and thoughts üòâ, plus I also needed to
        learn/practice React Transitions and React Styled Components. This
        project provied me with the perfect opportunity to do so üê±‚Äçüë§

        Starting out with learning React, this little project was able to cover
        a lot of important bases for me like: React Hooks, React Functional
        Components, routing with React Router DOM and how to use React Context
        API for state management(still learning more about this üòã). I also
        realised the tremendous amount of effort and consideration that goes
        into creating a rich user experience even a simple change of a css
        property like a margin on a button can change the look and feel of the
        experience ü§©.
